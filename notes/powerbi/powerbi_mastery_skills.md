# Power BI Mastery Skills Roadmap

Becoming a Power BI expert means mastering data visualization, modeling, DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), data transformation, and real-world dashboard development. Here’s your complete roadmap, step-by-step:

---

✅ **1. Fundamentals of Power BI**

🔹 **Learn the Core Tools**
- Power BI Desktop – Main authoring tool
- Power BI Service – Cloud-based sharing and collaboration
- Power BI Mobile – For on-the-go dashboards
- Power BI Gateway – Connects on-premise data to the cloud

📚 **Learn:**
- Installing Power BI Desktop
- Importing and connecting to data (Excel, SQL Server, Web, etc.)
- Understanding the interface (fields pane, report canvas, visualizations pane)

---

✅ **2. Data Loading & Transformation (Power Query)**

📊 **Master ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)**
- Use Power Query Editor
- Clean and shape data (remove nulls, merge, split columns, change types)
- Append vs Merge queries
- Understand M Language (used behind Power Query)

---

✅ **3. Data Modeling**

🧠 **Learn to:**
- Build relationships between tables
- Understand star schema vs snowflake schema
- Create calculated columns and tables
- Normalize and denormalize data

---

✅ **4. DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**

This is key to being a real expert.

🎯 **Start with:**
- Calculated columns vs measures
- Aggregation functions: SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT, DISTINCTCOUNT
- Time intelligence: TOTALYTD, DATESINPERIOD, SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR
- Filter functions: CALCULATE, FILTER, ALL, REMOVEFILTERS
- Advanced: RANKX, EARLIER, VAR, SWITCH

---

✅ **5. Visualization & Reporting**

📈 **Learn to:**
- Use all major visuals: bar, line, matrix, card, slicers, maps, etc.
- Format and customize visuals
- Create interactive dashboards
- Use bookmarks, drillthroughs, tooltips, filters, slicers, and buttons
- Implement KPI and gauge indicators

---

✅ **6. Power BI Service (Cloud)**

☁️ **Skills:**
- Publish reports to Power BI service
- Create and share dashboards
- Set up scheduled data refresh
- Manage workspace roles and access
- Use Power BI apps for deployment

---

✅ **7. Advanced Topics**

💡 **Learn:**
- Row-Level Security (RLS): restrict access to data by user
- Power BI Gateway: hybrid connectivity
- Performance tuning: optimize DAX and data model
- Custom visuals: import or develop using TypeScript
- Paginated Reports: via Power BI Report Builder (like SSRS)
- Power BI REST API: automate deployment and data management

---

✅ **8. Real-World Practice & Portfolio**
- Recreate real-world dashboards (e.g., sales, HR, finance)
- Join challenges on Kaggle, Maven Analytics, or Makeover Monday
- Build a GitHub or personal portfolio to showcase your reports

---

✅ **9. Certifications (Optional but Helpful)**
- 📘 PL-300: Microsoft Power BI Data Analyst (formerly DA-100)
- 📘 Exam DP-500: For advanced analytics and Power BI with Azure

---

✅ **10. Complementary Skills**
- Basic SQL for querying data
- Excel – pivot tables, formulas (many Excel users transition to Power BI)
- Understanding business KPIs
- Exposure to Azure, Power Platform, Dataverse is a plus
