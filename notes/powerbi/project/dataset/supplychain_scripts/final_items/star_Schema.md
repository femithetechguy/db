Here’s how to **establish relationships** and determine if your Supply Chain schema is a **star** or **snowflake** schema, based on your dataset descriptions:

---

## 1. **Establishing Relationships**

### **Fact Tables** (Transactional Data)
- **Sales & Demand Data** (Order lines)
- **Inventory Data**
- **Procurement & Supplier Data** (Purchase Orders)
- **Production & Manufacturing Data**
- **Logistics & Transportation Data** (Shipments)
- **Returns & Quality Data**

### **Dimension Tables** (Reference/Master Data)
- **Product Master Data**
- **Location Master Data**
- **Supplier Master Data**
- **Customer Master Data**
- **Carrier Master Data**

### **Typical Foreign Key Relationships**
- **Sales & Demand**:  
  - `Product ID` → Product Master  
  - `Customer ID` → Customer Master  
  - `Order ID` (links to Returns, Logistics, etc.)
- **Inventory**:  
  - `Product ID` → Product Master  
  - `Location ID` → Location Master
- **Procurement**:  
  - `Product ID` → Product Master  
  - `Supplier ID` → Supplier Master
- **Production**:  
  - `Product ID` → Product Master  
  - `Component Product ID` → Product Master  
  - `Machine ID` (could link to a Machine/Work Center Master)
- **Logistics**:  
  - `Order ID` → Sales/Procurement  
  - `Product ID` → Product Master  
  - `Origin/Destination Location ID` → Location Master  
  - `Carrier ID` → Carrier Master
- **Returns**:  
  - `Order ID` → Sales  
  - `Product ID` → Product Master

## 2. **Schema Type: Star or Snowflake?**

### **Star Schema**
- **Fact tables** are at the center.
- **Dimension tables** are directly connected to fact tables.
- **Dimension tables are not normalized** (all descriptive attributes in one table).

### **Snowflake Schema**
- **Dimension tables are normalized** (e.g., Product Master links to Product Category table, Location Master links to Region table, etc.).
- More tables, more joins.

---

### **Your Described Structure**

- Your master data (Product, Location, Supplier, Customer, Carrier) is **not further broken down** into sub-tables (e.g., Product Category, Region, etc.).
- All facts reference dimensions **directly** via foreign keys.
- **No evidence of normalized sub-dimensions** in your description.

---

## **Conclusion**

**Your schema is a _star schema_.**

- Fact tables (Sales, Inventory, Procurement, etc.) are at the center.
- Dimension tables (Product, Location, Supplier, Customer, Carrier) are directly linked.
- No further normalization of dimensions is described.

---

### **Best Route to Follow**

- **Implement a star schema** for your dashboard:  
  - Central fact tables for each process (Sales, Inventory, Procurement, etc.).
  - Dimension tables for Product, Location, Supplier, Customer, Carrier.
- **Add snowflake normalization only if**:  
  - Your dimension tables become very large and repetitive (e.g., many products share the same category and you want to manage categories separately).
- **Use foreign keys** in your fact tables to reference the primary keys of your dimension tables.

**Summary Table Example:**

| Fact Table         | Dimension Tables Linked                        |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Sales              | Product, Customer, Date, Location             |
| Inventory          | Product, Location, Date                       |
| Procurement        | Product, Supplier, Date, Location             |
| Production         | Product, Machine, Date, Location              |
| Logistics          | Product, Carrier, Location, Date, Order       |
| Returns            | Product, Customer, Date, Order                |

**If you later need more granular analysis (e.g., by Product Category or Region), you can snowflake those dimensions. But for most dashboards, a star schema is best for performance and simplicity.**
