Here’s how to **establish relationships** and determine if your Claims Analysis Dashboard schema is a **star** or **snowflake** schema, based on your dataset descriptions:

---

## 1. **Establishing Relationships**

### **Fact Tables** (Transactional Data)
- **Core Claims Data** (Claims)
- **Claim Financial Transactions/Payments**
- **Claim Reserve Data**
- **Workflow/Milestone Data**

### **Dimension Tables** (Reference/Master Data)
- **Policy Data**
- **Policyholder/Insured Data**
- **Claim Handler/Adjuster Data**
- **External/Reference Data** (optional enrichments)

### **Typical Foreign Key Relationships**
- **Claims**:  
  - `Policy Number` → Policy Data  
  - `Insured/Policyholder ID` → Policyholder/Insured Data  
  - `Claim ID` is the central key for linking all claim-related facts and dimensions.
- **Claim Financial Transactions/Payments**:  
  - `Claim ID` → Claims
- **Claim Reserve Data**:  
  - `Claim ID` → Claims
- **Workflow/Milestone Data**:  
  - `Claim ID` → Claims
- **Claim Handler/Adjuster Data**:  
  - `Adjuster ID` → Adjuster Dimension  
  - `Claim ID` → Claims

## 2. **Schema Type: Star or Snowflake?**

### **Star Schema**
- Fact tables are at the center.
- Dimension tables are directly connected to fact tables.
- Dimension tables are **not normalized** (all descriptive attributes in one table).

### **Snowflake Schema**
- Dimension tables are **normalized** (e.g., Policyholder/Insured Data split into separate tables for address, demographics, etc.).
- More tables, more joins.

---

### **Your Described Structure**

- Your master data (Policy, Policyholder, Adjuster) is **not further broken down** into sub-tables.
- All facts reference dimensions **directly** via foreign keys.
- **No evidence of normalized sub-dimensions** in your description.

---

## **Conclusion**

**Your schema is a _star schema_.**

- Fact tables (Claims, Payments, Reserves, Milestones) are at the center.
- Dimension tables (Policy, Policyholder, Adjuster, etc.) are directly linked.
- No further normalization of dimensions is described.

---

### **Best Route to Follow**

- **Implement a star schema** for your dashboard:  
  - Central fact tables for each process (Claims, Payments, Reserves, Milestones).
  - Dimension tables for Policy, Policyholder, Adjuster, etc.
- **Add snowflake normalization only if**:  
  - Your dimension tables become very large and repetitive (e.g., many policies share the same product type and you want to manage product types separately).
- **Use foreign keys** in your fact tables to reference the primary keys of your dimension tables.

**Summary Table Example:**

| Fact Table         | Dimension Tables Linked                        |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Claims             | Policy, Policyholder, Adjuster, Date, Location|
| Payments           | Claims, Date, Payee Type                      |
| Reserves           | Claims, Date, Reserve Type                    |
| Milestones         | Claims, Date, Milestone Name                  |

**If you later need more granular analysis (e.g., by Product Type or Customer Segment), you can snowflake those dimensions. But for most dashboards, a star schema is best for performance and simplicity.**
