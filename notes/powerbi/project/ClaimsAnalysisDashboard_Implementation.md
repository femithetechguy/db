# Datasets for a Claims Analysis Dashboard

To build a robust claims analysis dashboard, you'll need to gather data from various sources. The key is to be able to link these datasets together, typically using common identifiers like a **Claim ID**, **Policy Number**, or **Policyholder ID**.

## 1. Core Claims Data

This is the most fundamental dataset, serving as the backbone of your analysis.

* **Claim ID**: Unique identifier for each claim.
* **Policy Number**
* **Insured/Policyholder ID** (or name, if privacy allows)
* **Claim Status**: (e.g., Open, Closed, Denied, Approved, In Progress, Reopened)
* **Date of Loss/Incident Date**
* **Date Claim Reported**
* **Date Claim Opened**
* **Date Claim Closed** (if applicable)
* **Claim Type/Line of Business**: (e.g., Auto, Home, Health, Life, Property, Liability, Workers' Comp)
* **Cause of Loss**: (e.g., Accident, Theft, Fire, Flood, Illness, Injury)
* **Claim Severity**: (e.g., Minor, Moderate, Major, Total Loss)
* **Claim Subtype/Specific Event**: (e.g., Rear-end collision, Burst pipe, Flu, Slip and Fall)
* **Loss Location**: (City, State, Zip Code, or more granular if needed)
* **Reported By**: (e.g., Policyholder, Agent, Third Party)
* **Fraud Indicator**: (e.g., suspected fraud, confirmed fraud)
* **Subrogation Potential**: (Yes/No)

## 2. Financial Data

These datasets track the monetary aspects of claims, crucial for understanding costs and liabilities.

### Claim Financial Transactions/Payments Data

* **Claim ID**
* **Transaction Date**
* **Transaction Type**: (e.g., Payment, Reserve Adjustment, Expense)
* **Amount Paid**: (for each transaction)
* **Payment Category**: (e.g., Indemnity, Medical, Repair, Legal, Expense)
* **Payee Type**: (e.g., Policyholder, Vendor, Medical Provider, Legal Counsel)
* **Currency** (if applicable)

### Claim Reserve Data

* **Claim ID**
* **Reserve Date**: (Date the reserve was set or last adjusted)
* **Initial Reserve Amount**
* **Current Reserve Amount**
* **Reserve Type**: (e.g., Indemnity Reserve, Expense Reserve)

## 3. Policy and Customer Data

Understanding the policy context and customer demographics can reveal important patterns and risk factors.

### Policy Data

* **Policy Number**
* **Policy Effective Date**
* **Policy Expiration Date**
* **Product Name/Type**
* **Coverage Limits**
* **Deductible Amount**
* **Premium Amount**
* **Agent/Broker ID**
* **Underwriting Segment/Risk Class**

### Policyholder/Insured Data

* **Insured/Policyholder ID**
* **Demographics**: (Age, Gender, Marital Status - if relevant and permissible by privacy regulations)
* **Location**: (Address, City, State, Zip Code)
* **Customer Segment**: (e.g., High Value, Standard)
* **Years as Customer**
* **Number of Policies Held**
* **Previous Claims History**: (summary data, e.g., number of prior claims, total paid on prior claims)

## 4. Adjudication and Workflow Data

This data helps in understanding claim processing efficiency and identifying potential bottlenecks.

### Claim Handler/Adjuster Data

* **Claim ID**
* **Adjuster ID**
* **Adjuster Name**
* **Team/Department**
* **Adjuster Experience Level**

### Workflow/Milestone Data

* **Claim ID**
* **Milestone Name**: (e.g., Claim Assigned, Initial Contact Made, Investigation Complete, Settlement Offer Made)
* **Milestone Date**
* **Duration in Stage**

## 5. External/Reference Data (Optional but Valuable)

Depending on your industry and the types of claims, these datasets can significantly enrich your analysis.

* **External Economic Data**: (e.g., inflation rates, interest rates)
* **Geospatial Data**: (for mapping claims by location, especially useful for property or auto claims)
* **Weather Data**: (for property or auto claims impacted by specific weather events)
* **Repair Cost/Medical Cost Benchmarks**: (for comparing against actuals)
* **Fraud Detection Scores**: (from external fraud detection systems)

## Key Considerations for Your Dashboard:

* **Granularity**: Decide on the level of detail you need. For example, do you need every single payment transaction, or is a summary of total paid per claim sufficient?
* **Data Linking**: Ensure you have common keys (like **Claim ID**, **Policy Number**, **Policyholder ID**) across all datasets so you can join them effectively.
* **Data Volume**: Claims data can be very large. Consider performance implications when designing your data model.
* **Data Quality**: Accurate and consistent data is paramount for meaningful analysis.
* **Privacy and Security**: Especially with policyholder data, ensure you comply with all relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., HIPAA for health claims, GDPR, CCPA).
* **Dashboard Objectives**: Always keep in mind what questions you want your dashboard to answer (e.g., "What are our most frequent claim types?", "How long does it take to close a claim?", "What's our average cost per claim?", "Are certain agents generating more claims?", "What's our fraud rate?"). This will guide your data selection and dashboard design.

By carefully selecting and integrating these datasets, you can build a powerful claims analysis dashboard that provides deep, actionable insights into your operations.
