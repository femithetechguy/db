Absolutely! Here’s another strong Power BI project, this time focused on Supply Chain Optimization, formatted in Markdown:

# Power BI Project: Supply Chain Performance Dashboard

## 🧠 Objective
Create a Power BI report to monitor, analyze, and optimize supply chain operations including inventory levels, supplier performance, and order fulfillment across warehouses.

---

## 📊 Data Sources
- **Inventory Data:** SKU ID, Product Name, Quantity on Hand, Reorder Point, Warehouse Location
- **Procurement Data:** Supplier ID, PO Date, Delivery Date, Lead Time, Order Quantity, Cost
- **Sales Orders:** Order ID, SKU ID, Order Date, Ship Date, Region, Quantity Ordered
- **Warehouse Data:** Location, Capacity, Fulfillment Rate
- **Supplier Data:** Supplier Name, Reliability Score, Country

---

## 📈 Key Metrics & KPIs
- Inventory Turnover Ratio
- Stockout Rate
- Days of Inventory on Hand (DOH)
- Order Fulfillment Time
- Supplier Lead Time
- On-Time Delivery Rate
- Backorder Rate
- Cost per Unit Procured

---

## 🛠️ Features
- **Interactive Filters:** Filter by product category, region, supplier, warehouse
- **Inventory Heatmap:** Quickly see overstocked or understocked items
- **KPI Cards:** Display key metrics at a glance
- **Trend Charts:** Track inventory levels, fulfillment rates, and procurement cost over time
- **Supplier Scorecard:** Compare suppliers by lead time, cost, and delivery performance
- **Warehouse Performance View:** Analyze order volume, delays, and fulfillment rate per location

---

## 🧩 Skills Demonstrated
- Data modeling with related tables (star schema)
- Data transformation in Power Query (merging, appending, calculated columns)
- Advanced DAX calculations (lead time, DOH, fulfillment rate)
- Responsive design using bookmarks and slicers
- Real-world business logic like EOQ and safety stock levels

---

## 🧪 Bonus Feature (Optional)
**Forecasting Inventory Demand:** Use built-in Power BI forecasting or Python integration to predict future stock levels and avoid stockouts or overstocking.

---

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Microsoft Power BI Desktop
- Power Query
- DAX
- Excel/CSV for mock data
- SQL Server (optional backend)
- Python (optional for demand forecasting)

---

## 💡 Outcome
A comprehensive, data-driven dashboard that:
- Improves visibility across supply chain operations
- Reduces costs through better inventory and supplier management
- Supports faster, data-backed decision-making for procurement and logistics teams
