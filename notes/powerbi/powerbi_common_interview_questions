## ðŸŸ¢ Basic-Level Questions

### 1. What is Power BI?
**Answer:** Power BI is a business analytics service by Microsoft that provides tools for data modeling, visualization, and reporting. It connects to various data sources and helps create interactive dashboards and reports.

### 2. What are the main components of Power BI?
**Answer:**
- Power BI Desktop (report creation)
- Power BI Service (online sharing)
- Power BI Mobile (mobile access)
- Power BI Gateway (connects on-premise data)
- Power BI Report Builder (for paginated reports)
- Power BI Embedded (for developers)

### 3. Difference between Power BI Desktop and Power BI Service?
**Answer:**
- **Desktop:** For building and designing reports (local use)
- **Service:** For publishing, sharing, and collaboration (cloud-based)

### 4. What is DAX?
**Answer:** DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) is a formula language used in Power BI for creating calculated columns, measures, and custom aggregations.

### 5. What is Power Query?
**Answer:** Power Query is a data transformation and preparation tool in Power BI. It helps users extract, transform, and load (ETL) data before modeling.

### 6. What is a measure vs a calculated column?
**Answer:**
- **Measure:** Calculated on the fly based on filters (dynamic).
- **Calculated column:** Stored in the data model (static until refresh).

### 7. What are the different types of filters in Power BI?
**Answer:**
- Visual-level filter
- Page-level filter
- Report-level filter
- Slicers

### 8. What is a dashboard?
**Answer:** A dashboard is a one-page, interactive summary of visuals, typically created in Power BI Service by pinning visuals from one or more reports.

## ðŸŸ¡ Intermediate-Level Questions

### 9. Explain the star and snowflake schema.
**Answer:**
- **Star Schema:** Central fact table with denormalized dimension tables.
- **Snowflake Schema:** Dimension tables are normalized into sub-tables.

### 10. What is Row-Level Security (RLS)?
**Answer:** RLS restricts data access for users based on roles. You define DAX filters on a table and assign users to those roles.

### 11. What is the difference between DirectQuery and Import Mode?
**Answer:**
- **Import:** Loads data into Power BI; fast performance.
- **DirectQuery:** Queries the source in real-time; useful for large data sets but may be slower.

### 12. What is a relationship in Power BI?
**Answer:** A connection between two tables, defined by a common column (key), used to create a data model.

### 13. How do you handle performance issues in Power BI?
**Answer:**
- Optimize DAX measures
- Reduce number of visuals
- Use star schema
- Limit the number of rows and columns
- Aggregate data at the source

### 14. What is a slicer in Power BI?
**Answer:** A slicer is a visual filter that allows users to filter data interactively by categories like date, region, or product.

### 15. How is data refreshed in Power BI?
**Answer:** Through:
- Manual refresh (in Power BI Desktop)
- Scheduled refresh (in Power BI Service)
- Live connection (DirectQuery)

### 16. What is the difference between SUMX and SUM?
**Answer:**
- **SUM:** Adds up a single column.
- **SUMX:** Evaluates a row-by-row expression over a table and sums the result.

## ðŸ”´ Advanced-Level Questions

### 17. What is CALCULATE in DAX?
**Answer:** `CALCULATE` modifies the filter context of an expression and is often used to apply custom filters in measures.

### 18. What are context types in DAX?
**Answer:**
- **Row Context:** The current row being evaluated.
- **Filter Context:** Filters applied to the data model, such as slicers and visuals.

### 19. What is ALL() used for in DAX?
**Answer:** `ALL()` removes filters from a column or table. Useful for calculating totals or percentages.

### 20. What is a composite model in Power BI?
**Answer:** A model that combines DirectQuery and Import mode in the same report.

### 21. Can you explain cross filter direction?
**Answer:** Determines how filters flow between related tables. It can be single or both directions.

### 22. What is a drillthrough page?
**Answer:** A page designed to show detailed information when a user clicks on a value in another report page.

### 23. What are bookmarks?
**Answer:** Bookmarks save the current state of a report page (filters, visuals) for storytelling or navigation.

### 24. How would you implement time intelligence in DAX?
**Answer:** Use functions like:
- `TOTALYTD`
- `SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR`
- `DATESMTD`
- `PREVIOUSMONTH`

### 25. How do you handle many-to-many relationships in Power BI?
**Answer:** Use bridge tables, composite models, or relationship cardinality settings.
