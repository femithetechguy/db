What you are going to do with DAX?

New Columns / Calculated Columns, New Measures & New Tables

TotSal = Emp[SAL]+Emp[COMM]
Unit Price=Orders[Sales]/'Orders Details'[Quantity]
Sum Of Sales = SUM(Orders[Sales])

ExpOfEmp = DATEDIFF(Emp[HIREDATE],TODAY(),YEAR)


Calculated Columns / New Columns, New Measures & New Table are created using 
DAX Functions, Operators, and Constants 

Revised Sal = 'EMP Details'[SAL]+1000

ExpOfEmp = DATEDIFF(Emp[HIREDATE],TODAY(),YEAR)

RvsdSal = IF(Emp[DEPTNO]=10,Emp[SAL]+1000,Emp[SAL]+2000)

==========================================
DAX Table and Column Name syntax

'Table Name'[ColumnName]
TableName[Column Name]

==========================================
New Column / Calculated Column ->Calculated Column will be created when you want a calculation for every row in your table.

Use a calculated column when you want to evaluate each row

Creating New Column / Calculated Column 

==========================================

Measures - Use a calculated measure when you are calculating percentages or ratios, or you need complex aggregations. 

Use a measure when you need an aggregate

Creating Measure

Types of Measures

Implicit Vs Explicit Measures

Implicit Measures are created when you drag raw numerical fields (like Sales, Profit, Quantity) into the values field well of a visual and 
manually select the aggregation mode (Sum, Average, Min/Max, etc.).

Explicit measures are created by actually entering DAX functions like below 
	Sum Of Sales = SUM(Orders[Sales])

Implicit measures are only accessible within the specific visualization in which it was created, and cannot be referenced elsewhere.

Explicit measures can be used anywhere in the report and referenced with other DAX calculations.
	Sum Of Sales = SUM (Orders[Sales])
	% Sales = [Sum Of Sales]/CALCULATE([Sum Of Sales],ALL(Orders))

Formulas - DAX Functions, Operators & Constants, Existing Columns

Types of Operators

Arithmetic Operators

+ (Addition)
- (Subtraction)
* (Multiplication)
/ (Division)
 ^ (Exponentiation)

=============================================

Comparision Operator


= (Equal to)
<> (Not equal to)
< (Less than)
<= (Less than or equal to)
> (Greater than)
>= (Greater than or equal to)

Rvsd Sal = IF(EMP[DEPTNO]=10,EMP[Sal]+1000,'EMP'[Sal]+2000)

=================================================

Text Concatenation Operator

& (ampersand)

==========================================

Logical Operators

&& (double ampersand) - AND
|| (double pipe symbol) - OR -> Deptno =10 || Deptno = 20 || Deptno =30
IN{} -> Deptno IN{10,20,30}
