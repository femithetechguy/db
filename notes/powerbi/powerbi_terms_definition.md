# Power BI Glossary ‚Äì Key Terms for Mastery

## üîß Core Concepts

**Power BI Desktop**: Main development tool for building reports and dashboards.  
**Power BI Service**: Cloud platform for sharing, collaboration, and publishing reports.  
**Power Query**: Data transformation tool used to clean, shape, and import data.  
**DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: Formula language for creating measures and calculated columns.  
**Data Model**: Structure of related tables used for analysis (includes relationships, measures, etc.).  
**Report**: A collection of visuals built on a dataset in Power BI Desktop.  
**Dashboard**: A single-page summary of visuals (pinned from reports) in Power BI Service.  

## üìä Data Handling

**Dataset**: The data imported or connected to for building visuals.  
**Query**: Instructions (in Power Query) for retrieving and transforming data.  
**Calculated Column**: A new column created using DAX that is stored in the model.  
**Measure**: A dynamic calculation using DAX that recalculates based on filters.  
**KPI (Key Performance Indicator)**: A visual indicator to track performance against a goal.  
**RLS (Row-Level Security)**: Restricts data visibility per user role.  
**Fact Table**: Table containing transactional data (e.g., sales).  
**Dimension Table**: Table containing descriptive data (e.g., product info).  

## üìê Data Modeling

**Star Schema**: Model with a central fact table linked to surrounding dimension tables.  
**Snowflake Schema**: A normalized version of star schema with additional hierarchy levels.  
**Relationship**: A connection between two tables based on a common field.  
**Cardinality**: The relationship type (e.g., one-to-many).  
**Cross Filter Direction**: Controls the flow of filters between related tables.  

## ‚öôÔ∏è DAX Functions

**CALCULATE**: Modifies filter context to evaluate expressions.  
**FILTER**: Returns a table that represents a subset of another table.  
**ALL**: Removes filters from a table or column.  
**RELATED**: Returns a related value from another table.  
**RANKX**: Ranks items based on a DAX expression.  
**SUMX / AVERAGEX**: Iterates over a table to calculate total/average.  

## üåê Service & Sharing

**Workspace**: A collaborative area in Power BI Service for report management.  
**App**: A packaged collection of dashboards and reports shared with users.  
**Gateway**: Bridges on-premises data sources with Power BI Service.  
**Schedule Refresh**: Automatically refreshes the dataset at set intervals.  
**Paginated Reports**: Pixel-perfect reports (like SSRS) for printing/exporting.  

## üß© Advanced & Development

**Custom Visuals**: User-created or marketplace visuals added to Power BI.  
**Bookmarks**: Save report states for navigation or storytelling.  
**Drillthrough**: Navigate to a detailed page based on selected data.  
**Tooltips**: Hover text visuals with additional data context.  
**Power BI REST API**: Used to programmatically manage Power BI resources.
