iate join types (e.g., `INNER JOIN` for matching rows only, `LEFT JOIN` for all rows from one table), indexing the columns used in join conditions to speed up lookups, and minimizing the data processed by filtering results with `WHERE` clauses before the join. Additionally, reducing the number of joins, avoiding unnecessary columns in the `SELECT` statement, and ensuring that the join conditions are based on indexed and selective columns can significantly enhance query efficiency. Proper join order and using database-specific optimization hints are also important for performance tuning.

**Reducing Subqueries**

Reducing subqueries is a common SQL optimization technique, especially when dealing with complex logic or large datasets. Correlated subqueries, which are evaluated once for each row in the outer query, can degrade the performance. Subqueries can often be replaced with `JOIN` operations. In cases where subqueries are reused, consider replacing them with Common Table Expressions (CTEs), which offer modularity and avoid repeated executions of the same logic. Limiting the result set returned by subqueries and storing the results of expensive subqueries in temporary tables for reuse can also improve performance.

**Selective Projection**

**Selective Projection**

Selective projection in SQL refers to the practice of choosing only specific columns (attributes) from a table or query result, rather than selecting all available columns. This technique is crucial for optimizing query performance and reducing unnecessary data transfer. By using `SELECT` with explicitly named columns instead of `SELECT *`, developers can improve query efficiency and clarity, especially when dealing with large tables or complex joins.

**GRANT & REVOKE**

**GRANT and REVOKE**

`GRANT` and `REVOKE` are SQL commands used to manage user permissions in a database. `GRANT` is used to give specific privileges (such as `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) on database objects to users or roles, while `REVOKE` is used to remove these privileges. These commands are essential for implementing database security, controlling access to sensitive data, and ensuring that users have appropriate permissions for their roles. By using `GRANT` and `REVOKE`, database administrators can fine-tune access control, adhering to the principle of least privilege in database management.


**Recursive Queries**

**Recursive Queries**

Recursive queries in SQL allow for the repeated execution of a query within itself, enabling the traversal of hierarchical or tree-like data structures. This powerful feature is particularly useful for handling nested relationships, such as organizational hierarchies, bill of materials, or network topologies. By using a combination of an anchor member (initial query) and a recursive member (the part that refers to itself), recursive queries can iterate through multiple levels of data, retrieving information that would be difficult or impossible to obtain with standard SQL constructs. This technique simplifies complex queries and improves performance when dealing with self-referential data.


**Pivot, Unpivot Operations**

**Pivot and Unpivot Operations**

Pivot and Unpivot operations in SQL are used to transform and reorganize data, making it easier to analyze in different formats. The `PIVOT` operation converts rows into columns, allowing you to summarize data and present it in a more readable, table-like format. For example, it can take sales data by month and convert the months into individual columns. Conversely, the `UNPIVOT` operation does the opposite—it converts columns back into rows, which is useful for normalizing data that was previously pivoted or to prepare data for certain types of analysis. These operations are particularly useful in reporting and data visualization scenarios, where different perspectives on the same data set are required.

**Window Functions: ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK, LEAD, LAG**

**Window Functions**

SQL Window functions enable you perform calculations on a set of rows related to the current row. This set of rows is known as a 'window', hence 'Window Functions'.

These are termed so because they perform a calculation across a set of rows which are related to the current row - somewhat like a sliding window.

**rank**

The `RANK` function in SQL is a window function that assigns a rank to each row within a partition of a result set, based on the order specified by the `ORDER BY` clause. Unlike the `ROW_NUMBER` function, `RANK` allows for the possibility of ties—rows with equal values in the ordering column(s) receive the same rank, and the next rank is skipped accordingly. For example, if two rows share the same rank of 1, the next rank will be 3. This function is useful for scenarios where you need to identify relative positions within groups, such as ranking employees by salary within each department.

**dense_rank**

`DENSE_RANK` is a window function in SQL that assigns a rank to ea
