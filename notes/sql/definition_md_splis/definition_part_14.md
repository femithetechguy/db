ch row within a window partition, with no gaps in the ranking numbers.

Unlike the `RANK` function, `DENSE_RANK` does not skip any rank (positions in the order). If you have, for example, 1st, 2nd, and 2nd, the next rank listed would be 3rd when using `DENSE_RANK`, whereas it would be 4th using the `RANK` function. The `DENSE_RANK` function operates on a set of rows, called a window, and in that window, values are compared to each other.


**lead**

`LEAD` is a window function in SQL that provides access to a row at a specified offset after the current row within a partition. It's the counterpart to the `LAG` function, allowing you to look ahead in your dataset rather than behind. `LEAD` is useful for comparing current values with future values, calculating forward-looking metrics, or analyzing trends in sequential data. Like `LAG`, it takes arguments for the column to offset, the number of rows to look ahead (default is 1), and an optional default value when the offset exceeds the partition's boundary.

**lag**

`LAG` is a window function in SQL that provides access to a row at a specified offset prior to the current row within a partition. It allows you to compare the current row's values with previous rows' values without using self-joins. `LAG` is particularly useful for calculating running differences, identifying trends, or comparing sequential data points in time-series analysis. The function takes the column to offset, the number of rows to offset (default is 1), and an optional default value to return when the offset goes beyond the partition's boundary.

**Row_number**

`ROW_NUMBER()` is a SQL window function that assigns a unique, sequential integer to each row within a partition of a result set. It's useful for creating row identifiers, implementing pagination, or finding the nth highest/lowest value in a group. The numbering starts at 1 for each partition and continues sequentially, allowing for versatile data analysis and manipulation tasks.

**CTES, Dynamic SQL**

**CTES (Common Table Expressions)**

Common Table Expressions (CTEs) in SQL are named temporary result sets that exist within the scope of a single `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, or `MERGE` statement. Defined using the `WITH` clause, CTEs act like virtual tables that can be referenced multiple times within a query. They improve query readability, simplify complex queries by breaking them into manageable parts, and allow for recursive queries. CTEs are particularly useful for hierarchical or graph-like data structures and can enhance query performance in some database systems.

**Dynamic SQL**

Dynamic SQL is a programming method that allows you to build SQL statements dynamically at runtime. It allows you to create more flexible and adaptable applications because you can manipulate the SQL statements on the fly, in response to inputs or changing conditions. Consider an application where a user can choose multiple search conditions from a range of choices. You might not know how many conditions the user will choose, or what they'll be until runtime. With static SQL, you would have to include a large number of potential search conditions in your `WHERE` clause. With dynamic SQL, you can build the search string based on the user's actual choices. Note that while the use of Dynamic SQL offers greater flexibility, it also comes with potential security risks such as SQL Injection, and should be used judiciously. Always validate and sanitize inputs when building dynamic queries.

Practice: Optimize queries and explore window functions with CTEs.

**Database Security Best Practices**

Database security is key in ensuring sensitive information is kept intact and isn't exposed to a malicious or accidental breach. Here are some best practices related to SQL security:

1.  **Least Privilege Principle**

    This principle states that a user should have the minimum levels of access necessary and nothing more. For large systems, this could require a good deal of planning.

2.  **Regular Updates**

    Always keep SQL Server patched and updated to gain the benefit of the most recent security updates.

3.  **Complex and Secure Passwords**

    Passwords should be complex and frequently changed. Alongside the use of `GRANT` and `REVOKE`, this is the front line of defense.

4.  **Limiting Remote Access**

    If remote connections to the SQL server are not necessary, it is best to disable it.

5.  **Avoid Using SQL Server Admin Account**

    You should avoid using the SQL Server admin account for regular database operations to limit security risk.

6.  **Encrypt Communication**

    To protect against data sniffing, all communication between SQL Server and applications should be encrypted.

7.  **Database Backups**

    Regular database backups are crucial for data integrity if there happens to be a data loss.

8.  **Monitoring and Auditing**

    Regularly monitor and audit your database operations to keep track of who
